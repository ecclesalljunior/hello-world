Welcome to Ecclesall Church of England Junior School. We hope that you find our school website useful and informative. We are extremely proud of our reputation as a friendly, happy and creative church school. We aim for excellence and all staff, children, parents and governors share this whole school vision.From September 2014 we began our exciting journey as a soft federation with an Executive Head Teacher across both Ecclesall CE Juniors and Ecclesall Infants developing a sense of shared identity and a common purpose between our two schools. We have already developed stronger links between our schools and Clifford Infant School, we share a joint vision improving the attainment, achievement and progression of our pupils and work closely on shared projects for the benefit of all our children.We want our children to be happy and safe and to enjoy their work whilst achieving their full potential. We want each child to be valued and recognised as an individual. We strongly believe that every child matters and have high hopes and high aspirations. We believe that all of our children have a bright and exciting future ahead of them. As part of keeping our children safe, we ensure that we adopt and the Preventing Extremism and Radicalisation policy, “Keeping Children Safe in schools” and all other policies from the Sheffield Safeguarding team.
